I've created a text-based Hangman game in Python using a word list that primarily features food items (burgers, pizza, pasta, etc.) 
<br>
and some popular Bengali snacks (fuska, belpuri, jhalmuri, dimchop). 
<br>
The game randomly selects a word from the list, presenting the player with a series of underscores representing the word's length. 
<br>Players then guess letters, and correct guesses are revealed in their appropriate positions. 
<br>Incorrect guesses accumulate until the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts, resulting in a loss.
<br>
The game's core mechanics are implemented in Python code without a graphical user interface (GUI),
<br>meaning players interact with the game solely through text input and output.
